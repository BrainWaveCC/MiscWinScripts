Miscellaneous Windows Shell Scripts

This is a repository of independent, disconnected Windows Shell scripts (aka Batch Files) that I've generated in support of various technology mailing lists and forums, including various Reddit subs.

These scripts are typically in response to a question or challenge, and made available for easy access.

I'm open to updating them and answering questions about them on a semi-regular basis.  😁
